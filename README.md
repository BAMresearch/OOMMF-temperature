# OOMMF-temperature
Provides input parameter files (MIF) to include temperature in micromagnetc simulations with the Object Oriented Micromagnetic Framework (OOMMF).

OOMMF can be found under https://math.nist.gov/oommf/

To simulate the movement of the macroscopic magnetic moment in ferromagnetic systems under the influence of elevated
temperatures, the stochastic version of the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) or the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a spin density of
one per unit cell can used. To apply the stochastic LL to micromagnetic simulations, where the spin density per unit cell
is generally higher, a conversion has to be performed. Details can be found in the literature1. Briefly:
To determine the scaling between the physical temperature (T_eff ) and the input parameter used as simulation temperature (T_sim )
the lattice constant (a_eff ) and the length of a elementary simulation cell (a_sim ) has to be set into relation. The temperature T_sim
as used in the simulation as input parameter can be determined from the physical temperature T_eff by:
T_sim =  (a_sim / a_eff) * T_eff 
The range where scaling can be applied one has to consider the temperature effects on the exchange length of the system.1
Cell sizes of 1-2 nm in combination with time steps around 1 fs are a reasonable starting points. Sample files for OMMF are
attached. These files can be used to determine the Curie temperature for the classical bulk magnets, iron, nickel and cobalt.
